# Deployment

Repository is hosted on Github and deployed on Heroku. I developed the website using the Code Institute template on Gitpod, and push to GitHub by the uses of the Gitpod terminal.

### Other platforms used

- An account with Heroku.

## Cloning the Project

When you finish logging into Github, navigate to the repository page, and select MS3-recipes. Above the file list, click on the Code button next to the Gitpod button (green button). Copy the URL. Open your terminal. Change the working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. Paste the URL after you have type git clone. eg $ git clone https://github.com/Username/repository-name Press enter and this will create a local clone.

Or

## Set up the local environment

## Procfile and Requirements.txt

- We need to make a list of all the Python dependencies for the project which can be done in the command line by creating a file "requirements.txt.

``$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`` 

- When we deploy to Heroku we need a specific file that lets Heroku know how to run the project and this is done in the command line also by creating a Profile.


``$ echo web: python app.py > Procfile`` (use capital P when writing Procfile).

- Also make sure you remove any added lines to the Procfile code as this can cause problems in Heroku running the project.

- How push to GitHub.
